# If...else Statements

---

## Content

The flow of the program depends on the order in which individual commands are executed. Control flow statements like `if...else` allow us to manage the order using conditions.

> The `if...else` statement is used in Python for this decision making.

```python
if <condition>:
  <execute this code>
```

The program will only execute the code *if the condition has been met*.

```python
num = 3
if num > 0:
  print(num, " is a positive number")
```

The code above will print `'3 is a positive number'`.

The `if` statement can be extended to include a *catch-all*, `else`, that will be executed if the condition is not met.

```python
num = 1
if num == 0:
  print("Zero")
else:
  print("Positive number")
```

The code above will print `'Positive number'`.

> ðŸ’¡ A single `=` is used for assigning values to variables, and the double `==` for comparison. There are several different *comparison operators*.

Comparison operators include:

| Operator            | Name                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `==`                | is equal to                                       |
| `!=`                | is not equal to                                   |
| `<`                 | is less than                                      |
| `<=`                | is less than or equal to                          |
| `>`                 | is greater than                                   |
| `>=`                | is greater than or equal to                       |
