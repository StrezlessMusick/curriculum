# The NaN Value


---

## Content

In JavaScript, `NaN` means **Not-A-Number** and is the result when math functions fail or when a function expecting a number is given a different type:

```js
// dividing by zero
// gives "not a number"
let x = 0 / 0;
console.log(x);
// NaN
```

It is a special value of type `"number"` to represent an invalid number.

One notable property of `NaN` is that it is never equal to itself:

```js
NaN === NaN // false
```


Imagine we needed to collect the `age` of every person in a classroom so that we may find the oldest person present. It's a simple calculation that could become quite complex if some of the `age` values are text instead of numbers.

We can tackle this issue using the `isNaN` function. If it's not a number, it will return true. Otherwise, false.

```js
isNaN(23) // false (it's a number)
isNaN("Twenty Three") // true (it's not a number)
```
